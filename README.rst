This is a collection of preconfigured roles that genastack will use to install 
Openstack bits and some of the accompanied services. 


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone this repo into either you home folder under ``/home/user/genastack_roles`` or 
place it in ``/opt/genastack_roles``.  Once these files are in place you can then run 
genastack and it will read in the new roles and allow you use them.
